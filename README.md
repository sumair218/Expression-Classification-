# Expression-Classification-
Expression Classification from Facial Images is a deep learning project aimed at classifying facial expressions into seven categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, or neutral. Using the ExpW dataset, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to recognize these expressions from images captured in real-world environments. The project addresses challenges like varying lighting, background clutter, and facial occlusions. Applications include Human-Computer Interaction and psychological assessment in virtual interviews. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and evaluated on performance metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.
